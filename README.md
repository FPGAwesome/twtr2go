# twtr2go
Small twitter scraper to learn some Golang and scraping techniques. Also get a little more javascript under my belt.

Current (very limited) commands planned/implemented

twtr2go posts <username>
  Gathers posts from a target username via the advanced search url
  
twtr2go followers <username>
  Gathers the followers for a given user
  
Flags will be added for dumping to a local/remote mysql database or a simple csv file, maybe some fun sentiment filtering with python in the loop.
